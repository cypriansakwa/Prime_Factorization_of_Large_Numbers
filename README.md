This Rust program uses the num-bigint and primal crates to perform prime factorization on an extremely large integer. The program iterates over all prime numbers, divides the target number by each one, and gathers the prime factors.

The program  takes a huge integer as input, factors it into its prime components, and calculates the time required for the factorization process. 
The prime factorization is accomplished by dividing the number by successive prime numbers acquired from the primal crates.
